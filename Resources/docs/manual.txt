Formicula 4.0 user manual
-------------------------     
Formicula supports an infinite number of contact forms with an infinite number 
of custom fields (ok, infinite as long as you have enough server memory).

Requirements
------------
Formicula 4.0 requires Zikula Core 1.4.3 or later. It *will not* run
with earlier versions - sorry. Use Formicula < 4.0 instead.
For creating captchas you need PHP compiled with the GD graphics library.

Installation
------------
1. Extract the files to your Zikula modules directory.
2. Initialize and activate the module in the admin section.
3. During installation, Formicula tries to create a cache directory inside /app/cache/formicula containing a .htaccess file.
   If this fails, you will be notified and have to create them on your own:
   a) Create the /app/cache/formicula directory and make it writable for the web server (e.g. chmod 777).
   b) Create a .htacess inside this directory containing the following lines to allow access to the
      images created for the captcha:
      SetEnvIf Request_URI "\.gif$" object_is_gif=gif
      SetEnvIf Request_URI "\.png$" object_is_png=png
      SetEnvIf Request_URI "\.jpg$" object_is_jpg=jpg
      Order deny,allow
      Deny from all
      Allow from env=object_is_gif
      Allow from env=object_is_png
      Allow from env=object_is_jpg
4. Create some contact names/topics with respective email adresses in the Formicula admin section.
   Upon installation, Formicula creates a default contact with the admin's mail address.
5. Add a basic permission rule, e.g.
   unreg. users (group) | ZikulaFormiculaModule:: | .* | ACCESS_COMMENT
   This enables unregistered users to use all existing forms. In a default installation
   the users group has a generic comment permission to do the same.
6. Add a link to your main menu with the zikulaformiculamodule_user_main route.
   This uses form 0. To call a specific form you need to add the argument "form: <formid>".
In the distribution package you will find sample forms 0, 1, 2 and 3.
0 is a normal contact form, while forms 1 and beyond are more extensive forms.

Configuration
-------------
- Show xxx: quick configuration enable/disable some fields in the userform.
  These fields may be (read: surely will be) removed in future versions.
- Send confirmation email to user: Tick this to send an confirmation mail to the user
  directory for uploaded files: Uploaded files get stored here. Make sure this directory is secured with a
  .htaccess file otherwise someone can upload malicious files and execute them!
- Delete file after sending: does what it says when ticked.
- Activate spamcheck: shows a little captcha in the form

Contacts
--------
Each contact consists of several information:

Contact name or Topic: The name that is shown to the user in the form, e.g. Webmaster
Email: The email to send the data to	
Public: tick this to make the contact available	for use.
Sender name: senders name as used in the users confirmation mail	
Sender email: senders email address as used in the users confirmation mail, e.g noreply@example.com	
Subject: enter a static subject or use these placeholders:
    * %s = sitename
    * %l = slogan
    * %u = site url
    * %c = contact name
    * %n<num> = user defined field name <num>
    * %d<num> = user defined field data <num>
 
Using own contacts
------------------
It is possible to pass own contacts to formicula instead using the formicula database.
To do this by a link you have to call the addSessionOwncontacts function in the User-API.
This function will return you an integer wich you should append with the index 'owncontacts'
to the URL pointing to Formicula.
If you want to embed your form you can pass the owncontacts directly to the form by adding
the owncontacts array to your arguments array.

The owncontacts array should contain the following values (per item) in both cases:
    * name the contact full name (required)
    * sname the contact secure name wich will be send to the submitter (optional)
    * email the contact email (required)
    * semail the contact email wich will be send to the submiter (optional)
    * ssubject the subject of the confirmation mail (optional) 

Templates
---------
Everything you want to do with the form is handled in the templates.
Store them in Resources/views/Forms/
The '#' at the beginning of the template designates the number of form.

The templates for the forms are named as follows:

The form with the input fields:  #_userform.html.twig
The page with the confirmation after submitting the data:  #_userconfirm.html.twig
The page with error messages after submitting data:  #_usererror.html.twig
The user's confirmation mail in text format:  #_usermail.txt.twig
The user's confirmation mail in html format:  #_usermail.html.twig
The admin mail in text format:  #_adminmail.txt.twig
The admin mail in html format:  #_adminmail.html.twig
This is the email that the admin gets after the user sends submits the userform.

Note: the email format can be chosen by using a dropdown like
    <select name="userformat">
        <option value="html">{{ __('Html') }}</option>
        <option value="plain">{{ __('Plain text') }}</option>
    </select>

Or if you want to force the type of email, you can use a hidden field in the form
    <input type="hidden" name="userformat" value="html" /> 

If you do not want to send a confirmation email to the user for a certain form, set
userformat to none:
    <input type="hidden" name="userformat" value="none" /> 

This overrides the setting in the configuration.

Standard fields
---------------
The standard fields to be used in forma are under userdata

* userdata[uname]: the users name (mandatory)
* userdata[uemail]: the users name (mandatory)
* userdata[url]: the users homepage (optional)
* userdata[location], userdata[phone], userdata[company]: these are obvious... (optional)
* userdata[comment]: normally a textarea for entering free text. Since 0.6 this is not longer 
  a mandatory field! HTML is stripped from the comments to avoid spam. In addition, the
  comment is send to Zikula's internal censor function. If the result differs from the 
  original comment, the submission is also treated as spam and not sent. This results
  in an error message. 
* captcha: mandatory if spamcheck feature is enabled, see 0_userform.html for an example

Custom fields
-------------
You can add as many custom fields to your form as you want. 
This makes it easy to create e.g. an online job application form if needed.

This makes it necessary to send certain information from the form page to the module.
The custom fields are numbered in old versions and an associative array in newer versions.

These are:
  
* custom[fieldname][name] (hidden field) name of the custom field
  can be used in the confirmation email
  
* custom[fieldname][mandatory] (hidden field) set to 1 if this is a mandatory field.
  Formicula checks this and shows an errormessage when this field is not filled

* custom[fieldname][data] (any kind of input field) the data with fieldname
  the payload

Example:

<label class="mandatory" for="foobar">{{ __('foobar') }}</label><br />
<input type="hidden" name="custom[foobar][name]" value="{{ __('foobar') }}" />
<input type="hidden" name="custom[foobar][mandatory]" value="1" />
<input type="text" required name="custom[foobar][data]" id="foobar" size="35" maxLength="80" value="{{ custom.foobar.data }}" />

Permissions
-----------
To use a form you need the right to COMMENT.

Unregistered | ZikulaFormiculaModule:: | .*  | ACCESS_COMMENT
all unregistered users are allowed to use all forms and write to all contacts

Unregistered | ZikulaFormiculaModule:: | 0:: | ACCESS_COMMENT
all unregistered users are allowed to use form 0 with all existing contacts.

Users | ZikulaFormiculaModule:: | 1:(2|3): | ACCESS_COMMENT
all members of the group Users are allowed to use form 1 and write to contact 2 and 3.

Use external information in the forms
-------------------------------------
You can use external information in the form by sending them in the url used to call
the form. These data are send in an associative array addinfo where the key is the name.

With

index.php?name=Formicula&type=user&func=main&form=2&addinfo[tid]=4&addinfo[pid]=17

you send two different information to the form 2 which can used in the userform template (in
this example 2_userform.html) with

{{ addinfo.tid }} => 4
{{ addinfo.pid }} => 17

As you can see you can use this to e.g. load data from other modules in the userform template.

Client side input validation
----------------------------
The supplied templates use a html5 input validation with webshims lib polyfill fallback. 

Captcha
-------
The simplecaptcha plugins adds an image with a very basic math equation (3 number from 1 to 2 
and either +, - or *) to the form if the spam check is enabled. If the user enters a wrong
value, Formicula redirects back to the page where it came from.

Formicula tries to create images in this order:
    * gif
    * jpg
    * png
If all these image types are not supported by your server, captchas are deactivated.
In this case Formicula turns the configuration option "Activate spamcheck" off.
